- **Interactive Charts** - Create publication-ready visualizations
- **Multi-Source Research** - Automatically aggregates data from multiple sources
- **Export & Share** - Download results, share analyses, and collaborate

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**For Cloud Usage:**
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key
- Valyu API key (get one at [platform.valyu.network](https://platform.valyu.network))
- Daytona API key (for code execution)

**For Local AI Models:**
- All of the above, plus:
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running
- At least one model installed (qwen2.5:7b recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yorkeccak/finance.git
   cd finance
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # OpenAI Configuration
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   
   # Valyu API Configuration
   VALYU_API_KEY=your-valyu-api-key
   
   # Daytona Configuration (for Python execution)
   DAYTONA_API_KEY=your-daytona-api-key
   DAYTONA_API_URL=https://api.daytona.io  # Optional
   DAYTONA_TARGET=latest  # Optional
   
   # App Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Your deployment URL in production
   
   # Ollama Configuration (Optional - for local models)
   # By default, Ollama support is DISABLED for production mode
   # To enable Ollama support, uncomment the line below:
   # APP_MODE=development  # Enable local model support
   OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434  # Default Ollama URL
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Check your configuration (optional)**
   ```bash
   npm run check-config
   ```
   This will show you whether Ollama support is enabled or disabled.

6. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### üè† Local Model Setup (Optional)

**Note**: By default, Ollama support is **disabled** for production mode. The app will use OpenAI/Vercel AI Gateway with rate limiting (5 queries/day).

For unlimited, private queries using your own hardware:

1. **Install Ollama**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ollama
   
   # Or download from https://ollama.com
   ```

2. **Start Ollama service**
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

3. **Install recommended models**
   ```bash
   # Best for tool calling (recommended)
   ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
   
   # Alternative options
   ollama pull qwen2.5:14b    # Better but slower
   ollama pull llama3.1:7b    # Good general performance
   ```

4. **Switch to local model**
   
   Click the "Local Models" indicator in the top-right corner of the app to select your model.

**Model Recommendations:**
- **Qwen2.5:7B+** - Excellent for tool calling and financial analysis
- **Llama 3.1:7B+** - Good general performance with tools
- **Avoid smaller models** - Many struggle with complex function calling

## üí° Example Queries

Try these powerful queries to see what Finance can do:

- "Build a Monte Carlo simulation to predict Tesla's stock price in 6 months"
- "Analyze GameStop's latest 10-K filing and extract key financial metrics"
